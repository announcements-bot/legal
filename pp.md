This is the privacy policy for the Announce Discord bot.

# In short

Announce stores the bot's profile name and avatar, IDs of messages sent by the bot, poll choices, messages that will be sent by the bot, channel IDs, and server IDs. No personal information is (or will be) stored.

# Why?

Announce stores this data for optional features such as:

- Scheduled announcements
- Polls
- Custom profiles

This list will be updated as Announce gains more features.

If a user removes the bot from your server, all data related to that server will be automatically deleted.

# Contact us

If you have any questions regarding the Privacy Policy or want to have your data manually removed, please contact us via our [support server](https://discord.gg/YKZ3cKujvb).
